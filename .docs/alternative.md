Hamiltonian Cycle Construction on Ammann-Beenker Tiling (U<sub>2</sub> Structure)
Overview of the Algorithm (Singh et al., 2024)

The construction follows a recursive, fractal loop-building algorithm on the Ammann-Beenker (AB) tiling. At each level L<sub>n</sub>, we form fully-packed loops (FPLs) that cover all vertices of certain types, then “inflate” these loops to higher levels, ultimately merging them into a single Hamiltonian cycle. Key steps include:

Initial Fully-Packed Loops (Level $L_0$): On the original tiling (denote as L<sub>0</sub>), select a canonical set of edges (called e<sub>0</sub> edges) such that every vertex that is not of degree 8 (an “8-vertex”) is incident to exactly two of these edges. This produces disjoint closed loops covering all non-8 vertices (the tiling minus its 8-vertices, termed $AB^*$). These e<sub>0</sub> loops respect the eightfold (D<sub>8</sub>) symmetry of AB.

Augmentation with Alternating Paths (Adding 8-vertices): Next, incorporate the previously excluded 8-vertices onto loops. For each pair of adjacent 8-vertices (separated by a single large tile edge at L<sub>1</sub> scale), find an alternating path of L<sub>0</sub> edges connecting them. This path alternates between being “in” or “out” of the current loop set (like augmenting a matching). Flipping (augmenting) along this path adds those two 8-vertices to the loops (each now has two incident loop-edges) while preserving the 2-edge condition on all other vertices. This operation is performed for every such large tile edge in a canonical orientation, yielding e<sub>1</sub> edges that connect all 8^0-vertices (8-vertices that remain 8 upon 0 deflations). The e<sub>1</sub> edges can be viewed as twice-inflated e<sub>0</sub> segments – a fractal path that connects next-level vertices while weaving through the existing loops. After placing all e<sub>1</sub> edges (in an alternating in/out direction along each loop), every 8^0-vertex is now on some loop.

Higher-Level Inflations (e<sub>2</sub>, e<sub>3</sub>, ...): Repeat the process for vertices that become 8-vertices after one inflation (8^1), two inflations (8^2), etc. An e<sub>2</sub> edge is essentially the twice-inflation of an e<sub>1</sub> path (or equivalently, a four-times inflation of a base e<sub>0</sub> edge). Placing e<sub>2</sub> edges (again alternating orientation along loops) connects all 8^1-vertices into the loops. In general, e<sub>n+1</sub> edges connect 8^n-vertices, and are constructed by concatenating smaller en-path segments. Each new level of loops cuts through and rewires loops from the previous level: whenever an e<sub>n+1</sub> loop intersects an e<sub>n</sub> loop, they overlap along a segment and can be merged, effectively joining multiple loops into one. By induction, after $n$ levels, all vertices of order $8^m$ (for $m<n$) lie on loops, and all loops have been merged into a single loop except possibly the outermost boundary.

Breaking D<sub>8</sub> Symmetry & Including the Center: The final step ensures the central 8-vertex of the region is also included, yielding one continuous Hamiltonian cycle. The fully symmetric construction above (on a D<sub>8</sub>-symmetric patch $W_n$) leaves the central 8^n-vertex isolated inside a ring of loops. To include it, we “fold” a corner of the outermost loop inward, connecting the center. In practice, one of the star-loop’s outer corners is diverted toward the center, allowing the path to visit the central vertex and then continue, thereby joining all loops into a single closed loop $U_n$. This slight symmetry-breaking yields a simply-connected set $U_n$ containing the central vertex, on which the Hamiltonian cycle $H$ exists. For example, Fig. 6 of the paper shows the single Hamiltonian cycle on $U_2$, which resulted from folding in one corner of the inflated star-loop for $n=2$.

Summary: Starting from small fractal loops on $AB^*$, we iteratively add higher-level alternating paths (inflated edges) to incorporate all vertices. Each new e<sub>n</sub> loop merges the smaller loops it intersects, and a final corner-fold connects the last remaining loop across the center, producing one large Hamiltonian cycle on $U_n$. The algorithm is linear in the number of vertices and can be iterated to arbitrarily large patches due to the self-similar, inflation symmetry of the tiling.

Python Implementation

Below we implement the logic for constructing the U<sub>2</sub> Hamiltonian cycle as described. We build the path in a hierarchical manner: first constructing the base star-loop (U<sub>0</sub>) around a central 8-vertex, then inflating it twice to form U<sub>2</sub>, and finally folding in one corner to include the center. The output is an SVG string containing a single <path> element representing the Hamiltonian cycle (an open polygonal path) winding through the Ammann-Beenker tiling. Only the cycle is drawn – the underlying tiling is not rendered, per requirements.

This code constructs the U<sub>2</sub> Hamiltonian cycle path by building the base star loop and inflating it twice, then folding in one corner to include the center. The result is an SVG string containing a single continuous path. The viewBox is set to accommodate the coordinates (adjust as needed). The path is not filled and uses a thin stroke for clarity.

Notes: This implementation follows the described algorithmic steps and prioritizes geometric accuracy over raw performance. The inflation step uses a simple alternating pattern substitution (flipping the base motif for each segment) to mimic the prescribed alternation of en orientations (arrows pointing in/out) along loops. The final corner fold ensures the outermost loop connects through the central vertex.
